1. Make nice powerups for all levels. 3 for paddle, 3 for ball as default.
2. Power up sounds, when spawned and when applied.
3. Sounds for new high score, sounds for level completion.
4. Make sure all music is the same sort of genre. (i.e, 8-bit, 16-bits, third.)
5. Sometimes after making a new player, the navigation system is weird in player options.
6. Make ball physics better.
7. Make collisions better, etc.
8. Better names for z and x. OK/FORWARD/CONFIRM?????
9. MAX 12 LEVELS!
10. Alle firkanter skal starte på samme x og y værdi, f.eks i level select og score select, osv.
11. Take pics and make a video of the game when its done, for your website as well as github.
12. The remaining screens should also make use of the new abstract classes.
13. Better icon.
14. The first time you're making a new player, some text is at the screen. It quickly flashes away. Let's try to get rid of this small "flash".
15. If you disable sound and then enable sound again, sound does not start again before you exit the current menu.
16. Sometimes the ball will go out a different way after it has had a ball powerup.
17. Sometimes a power up will have no visible effect on the Earth level. This happens to all levels, it seems.
18. When you go back to the level select screen after a level has been playing, the first level will be selected again. It should be the level that has just been played, that is selected. Also there seem to be no music after a level is won/lost?

18. Blackhole, Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Moon, powerups are done.
